In this React project, I have implemented a dynamic web application consisting of several components including `App`, `Header`, `Footer`, `Titles`, and `Content`. The core functionality involves managing state using React's `useState` hook to track and display selected content based on user interactions. The `Titles` component maps over a description array and allows users to click on titles to update the content displayed by the `Content` component. Throughout this project, I have learned how to effectively structure a React application, manage component state, pass props between components, and handle user events to update the UI dynamically. Additionally, I have ensured proper modularization by separating data and components into distinct files, improving code maintainability and readability.
